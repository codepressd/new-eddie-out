  A quick way to search rivers in California.

## About

  I'm a beginner kayaker and wanted a easy way to track river flows. The most well used river tracking
  website hasn't been updated for years and is pain to use.
  
  So I decided to build a more user friendly version.

## Getting Started

  It's pretty simple. Just signup so you can save your favorite rivers, so it's easy to track what the 
  river is doing in those areas. 
  
  You can either use the browse or map view to get specific information about the river. If you want to
  keep track of a certian river, just click the button that says "Add to favorites".
  
  That's it.
