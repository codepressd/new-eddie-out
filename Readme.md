## About

  I'm a beginner kayaker and wanted a easy way to track river flows. The most well used river tracking
  website hasn't been updated for years and is pain to use.
  
  So I decided to build a more user friendly version.

## Getting Started

  It's pretty simple. Just signup so you can save your favorite rivers, so it's easy to track what the 
  river is doing in those areas. 

  Or if you would like I have setup a demo account:

  email: demo@kayaker.com
  pass: demo
  
  You can either use the browse or map view to get specific information about the river. If you want to
  keep track of a certian river, just click the button that says "Add to favorites".
  
  That's it.

## Technology Used

  To build this App I used:
  
    Html
    Css
    Javascript
    Express
    Node.js
    Mongo DB

## Things to work on

  Here is a list of features I'm still working on:

    Make this app fullstack with a react or angular frontend.
  
    Fully mobile responsive - I have a few screen sizes where the lightbox needs to scale according 
    to screen size.
    
    Organize Browse - Right now the browse feature is just a list of river locations in really
    no order. I would like to organize them to regions of California.
    
    Chat Feature - I can't wait to implement this feature. I want there to be a way for boaters to 
    be able to meet up talk and organize trips together.
